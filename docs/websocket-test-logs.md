# WebSocket Test Logs

This document tracks all test runs and their results for the WebSocket implementation in our AI Interview Platform.

## Test Results History

### Test Run 1 (2025-03-11)
- Running `node tests/api/websocket.test.js` directly
- Result: 6 tests failed, 2 tests passed
- Main Error: Server connection refused (127.0.0.1:5001)
- Conclusion: Test server not running or not accessible

### Test Run 2 (2025-03-11)
- Running through `run-tests.sh` script
- Result: API tests passed, but WebSocket tests not included in main test suite
- Conclusion: Need to incorporate WebSocket tests in main test runner

### Test Run 3 (2025-03-11)
- Running after implementing OpenAI message validation fixes
- Command: `./test-websocket.sh 5000 automated`
- Result: All automated steps completed successfully
  - ✅ WebSocket connection established
  - ✅ Session creation successful
  - ✅ User message processed without OpenAI errors
  - ✅ AI response generated and received
  - ✅ Pause/resume operations successful
  - ✅ End interview operation successful
- Conclusion: Fixed OpenAI message validation issue with robust error handling

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Test Server Configuration
The test server for unit tests needs to be properly configured:
- The test server runs on port 5001, while our manual tests use port 5000
- The test server doesn't have proper WebSocket support initialized
- The test server isn't properly integrated with existing test fixtures

### 2. Test Suite Incompatibilities
- Official test suite expects different message format/types than our implementation
- Test suite doesn't properly handle authentication or setup prerequisites

## Next Steps

1. Update the test server to properly initialize WebSocket server on port 5001
2. Create message type mapping to handle differences between server and test expectations
3. Update the WebSocket test cases to properly set up test environment
4. Enhance WebSocketClient to add better error handling and reconnection logic
